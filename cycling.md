I stared road biking in April 2017 when I bought a used Tirreno Razza 3.0. It wasn't anything special but was a great starter road bike. In 2017 I upgraded to my current setup. My friend recommended Canyon but I also considered Specialized and Giant. The three things I was looking for were 105 components, hydraulic disk brakes, and a 1:1 gear ratio on the low end. This really helps out with all of the hilly terrain in SF. At the end of the day Canyon offered the best price for this.

### My Canyon Endurace AL 7.0

#### Tires - Continental Gatorskins (28 mm)

I've run Gatorskins for years and have never gotten a flat on one. My Canyon came with Mavic Yksion Pro UST tires, but after I got a flat I decided to upgrade to Gatorskins. My first road bike had 25 mm tires but the Canyon came with 28s so I stuck with 28s. The ride on 28 mm is a bit smoother.

#### Pedals - Shimano PD RS500 SPD-SL

My first road bike had Crank Brother's "egg beater" style pedals, however my friend convinced me to upgrade to SPD-SLs. In fact, he gave me a set as a birthday present. 

#### Seat - Specialized Phenom Comp (143 mm)

#### Shoes - Fizik R5

#### Computer - Garmin Edge 530 with speed, cadence, and heart rate sensors

#### Water bottle cages - Bontrager Elite (2x)

Simple and inexpensive.

#### Saddle bag - Banjo Brothers Deluxe

This came with my first road bike and it's worked fine for me, so I just moved it over. I carry a Microflate Nano CO<sub>2</sub> inflator, a spare tube, Park Tool VP-1C patch kit, and a Crank Brothers M10 multi-tool in my bag.

#### Bell - Crane E-Ne Bell

A bell is a necessity when biking around a city or on the Golden Gate Bridge.
