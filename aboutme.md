Hi, I'm Nic! I'm a software engineer living in San Francisco, CA.

### Work
I'm an aerospace engineer by training and have experience with C++, Python, UAVs, and embedded systems. I'm presently a software engineer at [Waymo](https://www.waymo.com) where we are working to bring safe and reliable self-driving cars to the world. Previously I worked at Lily Robotics, Airware, and Boeing (on the [YMQ-18 UAV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_A160_Hummingbird)). For more background see my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicholas-wiles-35805912).

### Play
Outside of work I enjoy cheese making, cooking, backpacking, and cycling. I also love to tinker with electronics and software.
