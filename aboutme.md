### Work
I've worked with unmanned systems my entire career from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to self-driving cars. I have 10+ years of experience with C/C++, Python, and embedded systems. I'm presently a software engineer at [Waymo](https://www.waymo.com) where we are working to bring safe and reliable self-driving cars to the world. Previously I worked at Lily Robotics, Airware, and Boeing (on the [YMQ-18 UAV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_A160_Hummingbird)).

### Play
Outside of work I enjoy cheese making, cooking, backpacking, and cycling. I also love to tinker with electronics and software.
