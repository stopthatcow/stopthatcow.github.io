Blue stilton and asiago

I stared making cheese in late 2017. My first batch was a Bel Paese, based off of [this](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCE31MqUy6nIMJ_f8y4R3_AA) tutorial. Since then I've gone on to make asiago, parmesean, blue stilton, gorganzola, brie, cammembert, crottin, chevre, caerphilly, montery jack, habanero cheddar, saint marcelin, manchego and more! Thirty plus cheeses!

### Recipes

Gavin Webber's YouTube [tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCE31MqUy6nIMJ_f8y4R3_AA) are a great resource. This the YouTube channel that I watched and followed when I was starting out. He breaks down the process in an easy to consume way and even has videos showing tastings! Once you feel more comfortable with the process you can move on to more complex [recipes](https://cheesemaking.com/collections/recipes). I also own a copy of [Home Cheese Making](https://cheesemaking.com/products/home-cheese-making-book) (4th edition) by Rikki Carroll. It's widely consitered *the* go-to book for home cheesemaking. It is a great resource!

### Supplies
I get most of my supplies from [New England Cheese Supply](https://cheesemaking.com/). They have a full range of cultures, rennets, moulds and molds. Be sure to join their email list as you get 10% off your first order.

### Custom equipment
Over the years I have put together some custom equipment for cheesemaking. Hopefully someday I will provide deep-dives into how each of these came together.

#### Cheese cave
A cheese cave is a must for those wishing to age cheese for long periods. I already owned a kegerator with a digitial temperature controller, so I was able to re-purpose it to age my cheeses. I also added a [IHC200 humidity controller](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01J1E5LWM/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and [dehumdifier](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B072C3NMK1/). If you don't have separate temperature controler you could use a [ITC608T](https://www.amazon.com/Inkbird-Temperature-Controller-Thermostat-Dehumidifier/dp/B00HV6TDWC/).

#### Cheese press

A cheese press is used to make hard cheeses such as cheddar and parmesean. I decided to build my own cheese press after not really finding what I was looking for in the market. I based my design on Gavin Webber's press. It is comprised of a large polyethylene cutting board that was cut and re-assembled with food-grade (316) stainless steel hardware. I got the hardware from [McMaster-Carr](https://www.mcmaster-carr.com). The cutting board came from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003HEWUFO/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1). I cut the cutting board using a recipricating saw and drilled all of the holes with my drill press. Not seen in the picture is a spring that sits between the top of the mold and the ram that allows 0 to 65 lbs of pressure to be applied to the mold.

#### Camembert caddie

Camemberts are usually made in open-ended molds. They require flipping upwards of 6 times while they are draining in order to properly consolidate. Usually each mold is placed in what Rikki Carroll calls a "sandwich" which adds a draning mat (usually bamboo or plastic mesh mat) and cutting board to both ends of a mold. Each mold must be flipped indivudually with 1 hand on each side leading to a very tedious process. To work around this I created a "caddie" that can hold and flip 6 cammbert molds at once. This ensures that they don't slip with flipping.
